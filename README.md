## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) (v1.0 or higher)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS account with permissions for Cognito, Amplify, and IAM

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

**Deploy everything with one command:**
```bash
# Initialize (first time only)
tofu init

# Deploy everything
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

This will:
- ✅ Deploy all AWS infrastructure (Cognito, S3, CloudFront, Amplify)
- ✅ Build your React app locally
- ✅ Upload to S3 automatically
- ✅ Configure CloudFront distribution
- ✅ Provide all URLs and endpoints

**Clean up when done:**
```bash
tofu destroy -auto-approve
```

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aws-website-hosting-user-auth-cognito
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure AWS Credentials

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

### 4. Deploy Everything (Infrastructure + App)

#### Deploy with OpenTofu:
```bash
# Initialize OpenTofu (first time only)
tofu init

# Plan the deployment
tofu plan

# Apply the configuration
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

**This will deploy everything:**
- AWS infrastructure (Cognito, S3, CloudFront, Amplify)
- Build the React application locally
- Upload built files to S3 automatically
- Configure CloudFront distribution
- Provide all URLs and endpoints

### 5. Your React App is Automatically Deployed!

**No additional steps needed!** OpenTofu automatically:
- Builds your React app locally
- Uploads it to S3
- Configures CloudFront distribution
- Sets up all environment variables

**Environment variables are automatically configured** in the deployed application.

### 6. Update Cognito URLs (Important!)

After the initial deployment, you need to update the Cognito callback and logout URLs to include your actual CloudFront and Amplify URLs:

1. **Get your URLs from the deployment output:**
   ```bash
   tofu output
   ```

2. **Update the URLs in `locals.tf`:**
   ```hcl
   cognito_urls = {
     localhost_https = "https://localhost:3000"
     localhost_http  = "http://localhost:3000"
     cloudfront      = "https://YOUR_ACTUAL_CLOUDFRONT_URL"  # Update this
     amplify         = "https://main.YOUR_AMPLIFY_APP_ID.amplifyapp.com"  # Update this
   }
   ```

3. **Apply the URL updates:**
   ```bash
   tofu apply -auto-approve
   ```

**Why this step is needed:** Cognito needs to know which URLs are allowed for authentication callbacks. The initial deployment uses localhost placeholders to avoid circular dependencies.

**Current Status:** Your Cognito User Pool Client is configured with localhost URLs only. Authentication will work locally but will fail from CloudFront and Amplify until you update these URLs.

### 7. Destroy Infrastructure (Optional)

When you're done with the demo, you can destroy the infrastructure to avoid ongoing AWS charges:

```bash
# Destroy all AWS resources
tofu destroy -auto-approve
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all AWS resources created by this project.

## 🔄 Complete Deployment Workflow

### Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. **🚀 Deploy Everything**
   ```bash
   tofu apply -auto-approve
   ```
   - Creates AWS Cognito User Pool

# Cleanup when done
tofu destroy -auto-approve      # Remove all AWS resources
```

## 🧪 Local Development and Testing

### Starting Local Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Variables for Local Testing

**Important**: The `.env` file must be in the root directory of your project (same level as `package.json`).

#### Automatic Creation (Recommended):
The `.env` file is automatically created during deployment. If you need to recreate it, copy the values from the deployment output.

#### Manual Creation:
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:
```bash
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_DhtukDlTR
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=3gi06h3n36cvgqt5g5ljeb39fe
REACT_APP_COGNITO_DOMAIN=react-auth-demo-dev
```

**Note**: Replace the values above with your actual Cognito configuration from the infrastructure deployment.

### Local Testing Workflow

1. **Ensure infrastructure is deployed**:
   ```bash
   tofu apply -auto-approve
   ```

2. **Environment variables are created automatically during deployment**

3. **Start local development**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Test authentication flow**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the Amplify authentication form
   - Test sign-up and sign-in functionality

### Debugging Local Development

Ensure your AWS user has the following permissions:
- Cognito: Full access
- Amplify: Full access
- IAM: Create and manage roles

#### Build Failures
Check the Amplify console for build logs and ensure all environment variables are properly set.

#### Destroy Issues
If the destroy command doesn't work as expected:
```bash
# Check OpenTofu state manually
tofu show
tofu destroy -auto-approve
```

#### Deployment Issues
If the deployment fails:
```bash
# Check OpenTofu state
tofu plan

# Run deployment manually
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

#### Amplify App Shows "Welcome" Message
If your Amplify app shows the default welcome message:
1. **Check if Git repository is connected**:
   - Go to Amplify Console → Your App → Hosting environments
   - Verify main branch shows "Connected" status

2. **Verify build settings**:
   - Check that build spec matches your React app
   - Ensure `baseDirectory: build` is set correctly

3. **Check build logs**:
   - Go to Amplify Console → Your App → Builds
   - Review build logs for any errors

4. **Manual connection**:
   - Follow Git repository connection steps in AWS Console
   - Connect your repository to trigger automatic deployments

#### React App Build Failures
If `npm run build` fails:
1. **Check dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Verify environment variables**: Check `.env` file exists
3. **Check for syntax errors**: Review console output
4. **Test locally first**: `npm start` to verify app works

#### Cognito Authentication Issues
If authentication doesn't work:
1. **Verify environment variables** in `.env` file
2. **Check Cognito User Pool** is active in AWS Console
3. **Verify callback URLs** include `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Check environment variables** in the deployed application
5. **Ensure Cognito URLs are updated** with actual CloudFront and Amplify URLs (see step 6 in deployment)

#### Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Issues
If Elastic Beanstalk deployment fails:

**Common Issues:**
1. **Platform Compatibility**: Amazon Linux 2023 may have compatibility issues
   ```bash
   # Try switching to Amazon Linux 2
   # Update solution_stack_name in elasticbean.tf
   solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v5.8.0 running Node.js 18"
   ```

2. **VPC Configuration Issues**: 
   ```bash
   # Check if default VPC exists
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=is-default,Values=true"
   
   # If no default VPC, create one or use existing VPC
   ```

3. **Instance Deployment Failures**:
   - Check Elastic Beanstalk logs in AWS Console
   - Verify deployment package structure
   - Ensure Procfile and package.json are correct

4. **Solution Stack Not Found**:
   ```bash
   # List available solution stacks
   aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks --query 'SolutionStacks[?contains(@, `Node.js`)]'
   ```

**Recommended Workaround**: Use S3 + CloudFront for reliable static hosting, or Amplify for rapid deployment.

#### **Common Error Patterns**
- **"Your source bundle has issues"** → Check deployment package structure and file conflicts
- **"Instance deployment failed"** → Review environment events for specific error details  
- **"Unable to assume role"** → Verify IAM roles and policies are correctly configured
- **"VPC configuration errors"** → Check subnets, security groups, and internet gateway settings

### 🚨 **Current Issues**

#### **Platform Compatibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Amazon Linux 2023 platform has limited Node.js container support
- **Error**: `Unknown or duplicate parameter: NodeCommand/NodeVersion/ProxyServer`
- **Impact**: Deployment fails during environment creation

#### **VPC Configuration Complexity**
- **Problem**: Default VPC requirements and subnet conflicts
- **Error**: `A load balancer cannot be attached to multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone`
- **Impact**: Environment creation fails with networking errors

#### **Instance Communication Failures**
- **Problem**: EC2 instances fail to communicate with Elastic Beanstalk service
- **Error**: `The EC2 instances failed to communicate with AWS Elastic Beanstalk`
- **Impact**: Environment remains in `CREATE_FAILED` state

#### **Solution Stack Limitations**
- **Problem**: Limited solution stack options for Node.js 20
- **Impact**: Forced to use older Node.js versions or incompatible platforms

### 🔮 **Future Solutions (Planned Updates)**

#### **1. Platform Migration Strategy**
```bash
# Planned: Switch to Amazon Linux 2 with Node.js 18
solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2 v5.8.0 running Node.js 18"
```
- **Why**: Better Node.js container support and stability
- **Timeline**: Next update cycle
- **Impact**: Resolves container configuration issues

#### **2. Simplified VPC Approach**
```hcl
# Planned: Remove explicit VPC configuration
# Let Elastic Beanstalk manage networking automatically
```
- **Why**: Reduces complexity and potential conflicts
- **Timeline**: Immediate next deployment
- **Impact**: Eliminates subnet and VPC configuration errors

#### **3. Alternative Deployment Methods**
- **Docker-based Deployment**: Use Docker containers for better portability
- **Platform-as-a-Service**: Consider AWS App Runner as alternative
- **Container Services**: ECS or EKS for more control

#### **4. Enhanced Error Handling**
```hcl
# Planned: Add retry logic and better error reporting
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "react_env" {
  # Add retry configuration
  # Add detailed error logging
  # Add health check improvements
}
```

#### **5. Monitoring and Debugging**
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Better logging and monitoring
- **Health Check Improvements**: More robust health monitoring
- **Deployment Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failures

### 📋 **Action Items for Next Update**

1. **Immediate (Next Deployment)**:
   - [ ] Switch to Amazon Linux 2 platform
   - [ ] Remove explicit VPC configuration
   - [ ] Simplify deployment package structure

2. **Short Term (Next 2-3 Updates)**:
